# T_Cell_Exhaustion

MATLAB code associated with the manuscript "Mitigating non-genetic resistance to checkpoint inhibition based on multiple states of immune exhaustion" published in npj Systems Biology and Applications
- To perform the protocol sweeps (Figure 3, Figure S1, Figure S2), run: exhaustion_stages_model_protocol_sweeps.m
- To study the impact of the threshold to terminal exhaustion (F2) across a simulated population (Figure 6), run: exhaustion_stages_model_protocol_sweep_F2_varyDose_fixCumDose.m
- To study the impact of changing the assumption that inflammation triggers the transition to T cell exhaustion to antigen exposure triggering the transition (Figure S4), run: exhaustion_stages_model_protocol_sweeps_antigen.m
- To generate the sensitivity plots (Figure 7), run: exhaustion_stages_model_sensitivity_over_protocols.m
