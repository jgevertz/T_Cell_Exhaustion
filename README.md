MATLAB code associated with the manuscript "Mitigating non-genetic resistance to checkpoint inhibition based on multiple states of immune exhaustion"
- To explore models dynamics at a fixed protocol (Figure 2, Figure 4), run: exhauston_stages_model_single_protocol.m
- To perform the protocol sweeps (Figure 3, Figure S1, Figure S3), run: exhaustion_stages_model_protocol_sweeps.m
- To study the impact of the threshold to terminal exhaustion (F2) across a simulate dpopulation (Figure 5), run: exhaustion_stages_model_protocol_sweep_F2_varyDose_fixCumDose.m
